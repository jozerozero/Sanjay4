217,download_data_path/process_wavs/15.wav,but we who was a finalist for this year's James Beard Rising Star Chef award has still managed to find a silver lining
218,download_data_path/process_wavs/98.wav,does that sort of translate ultimately into distrust
219,download_data_path/process_wavs/105.wav,you don't need to worry about getting covid-19 in your tap water
220,download_data_path/process_wavs/46.wav,and she's hoping the industry as a whole does the same especially in the areas where it was struggling

236,download_data_path/process_wavs/275.wav,another country the note South Korea which has been applauded for how well it handled the pandemic thanks to its thorough testing and contact tracing process
237,download_data_path/process_wavs/272.wav,I keep in mind emergency use authorization doesn't mean that this is an FDA-approved drug
238,download_data_path/process_wavs/196.wav,so how available are PCR and antibody tests to the general public is probably the question I get more than any other
239,download_data_path/process_wavs/256.wav,let me be clear about this under no circumstances should you ingest or inject any cleaning products
240,download_data_path/process_wavs/36.wav,but that doesn't mean pools may not be shut down in certain areas this summer

268,download_data_path/process_wavs/7.wav,the agency said Monday that it was tightening its policy to keep on proving and even fraudulent s from entering the market
269,download_data_path/process_wavs/80.wav,but that's the long-term

271,download_data_path/process_wavs/132.wav,if all goes well results usually come back within a few hours but I can take a few days if you have to send it to a lab somewhere
272,download_data_path/process_wavs/274.wav,and remember this testing does need to go hand-in-hand with contact racing
273,download_data_path/process_wavs/5.wav,since then there have been a lot of unauthorized unvalidated tests which it flooded the market
274,download_data_path/process_wavs/175.wav,at least two cats and a dog have tested positive in the United States
