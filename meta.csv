11,process_wavs/151.wav,the lack of an adequate stockpile and Global Supply Chain disruptions have contributed to this issue

19,process_wavs/120.wav,city and county officials created a makeshift homeless shelter in a parking lot
20,process_wavs/245.wav,so the benefits of antibody testing are clear
21,process_wavs/182.wav,you know what's interesting I've traveled to so many places around the world and it always strikes me that many Americans are not really used to dealing with scarce resources
22,process_wavs/215.wav,will number one be suspicious of any product that claims to have a quick fix
