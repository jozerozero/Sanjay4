download_data_path/process_wavs/43.wav	early on there were some significant delays in testing

download_data_path/process_wavs/253.wav	so I turned to him for insight on our post-pandemic future

download_data_path/process_wavs/61.wav	after speaking with the nurse. Decided to go in for her appointment

download_data_path/process_wavs/179.wav	even before the pandemic she was already working on a digital identity project called a known traveler identity program

download_data_path/process_wavs/202.wav	the future could lie in at home testing

download_data_path/process_wavs/180.wav	according to the guardian scientist working for the US military have designed a PCR test that has the potential to detect a virus as early as just 24 hours after its contracted

download_data_path/process_wavs/118.wav	could we soon be using these contact tracing apps here in the United States

download_data_path/process_wavs/37.wav	sound familiar deer has a pretty good idea of what is current students probably feel

download_data_path/process_wavs/32.wav	too many these measures may seem a little over the top

download_data_path/process_wavs/212.wav	and at the same time we hear maybe there's going to be another wave or this isn't going to really go away

download_data_path/process_wavs/116.wav	and if their families and loved ones are safe as well

download_data_path/process_wavs/151.wav	she's a special education teacher on Long Island and works with 3 to 5 year olds who have special needs

download_data_path/process_wavs/204.wav	if you're used to going out as being a curated dining experience Lynch describes the post-pandemic world as sort of a safety-focused obstacle course

download_data_path/process_wavs/87.wav	the PCR test would still be the most accurate

download_data_path/process_wavs/177.wav	and finally there is a vaccine for the flu

download_data_path/process_wavs/232.wav	those involve collecting a small blood sample either through a needle in the vein or three blood spot sample

download_data_path/process_wavs/198.wav	I want to remind you that this study has nothing to do with how soon we might see a vaccine for the Coronavirus

download_data_path/process_wavs/71.wav	for example for restaurant Maymay is open for delivery and is also hosting virtual dumpling classes

download_data_path/process_wavs/211.wav	the Australian government has asked more vulnerable staffers and their schools to work from home if possible

download_data_path/process_wavs/120.wav	doctors are seeing their patients on video or over the phone and medical records are being shared more often electronically

download_data_path/process_wavs/245.wav	what is a sign that the FDA believes that the benefits of this drug outweigh the risks in certain patients

download_data_path/process_wavs/182.wav	are we going to have to download apps

download_data_path/process_wavs/215.wav	now that's the one that detects whether or not someone is currently infected with covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/139.wav	and how he's taking care of his own Mental Health

download_data_path/process_wavs/205.wav	and it's still unclear how much those antibodies might protect you from the virus in the future

download_data_path/process_wavs/40.wav	do you think that we're going to see any long-term shifts away from cities during this time or even in the aftermath

download_data_path/process_wavs/229.wav	meanwhile countries around the world are trying different approaches to keep the pandemic at Bay

download_data_path/process_wavs/35.wav	Eric Schmidt used to be the CEO of Google

download_data_path/process_wavs/114.wav	restaurants are going to have to tailor safety measures to suit their capabilities and it is possible not everyone can physically accommodate these recommendations

download_data_path/process_wavs/233.wav	still there was a reported up dick and calls and places like Maryland in Illinois about people ingesting disinfectants to try and kill the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/23.wav	so what does this mean for all of us

download_data_path/process_wavs/225.wav	even though she says the survival of the restaurant is in her biggest concern

download_data_path/process_wavs/156.wav	and they mean the diagnostic or PCR test in this case

download_data_path/process_wavs/187.wav	privacy rights experts say that we should be wary of companies promising Grand Tech Solutions

download_data_path/process_wavs/56.wav	antigen test would be the easiest to mass-produce for home use

download_data_path/process_wavs/107.wav	dear teachers World History 2 seniors and AP Human Geography for freshman

download_data_path/process_wavs/86.wav	a Chris dear the Louisiana teacher whose own senior year was interrupted by Hurricane Katrina said this pandemic once again highlights the need for more investment in education

download_data_path/process_wavs/230.wav	and sometimes those people need to be quarantined as well

download_data_path/process_wavs/240.wav	White House coronavirus Task Force member dr. Deborah Burke said this last month on NBC's Meet the Press

download_data_path/process_wavs/52.wav	that's similar to the effect of the drug Tamiflu has on the flu

download_data_path/process_wavs/173.wav	a hoax started in the fringes of the internet suggested that 5G that's the ultra-fast wireless technology is responsible for the spread of the Coronavirus

download_data_path/process_wavs/160.wav	that's Jennifer granek an attorney from the American civil liberties Union

download_data_path/process_wavs/74.wav	on his Twitter feed Chang is also been asking people to send him photos of reopened restaurants in cities like Taipei and Hong Kong

download_data_path/process_wavs/228.wav	so if you've been around on this planet for a while you probably have some immunity to it even if the flu virus changes a bit season-to-season

download_data_path/process_wavs/101.wav	again if these nasal swabs that have been in such short supply in so many places around the country

download_data_path/process_wavs/192.wav	in April there were reports of people actually tried to burn down cell phone towers in the UK

download_data_path/process_wavs/266.wav	later that day she got a call from her doctor to discuss the results

download_data_path/process_wavs/48.wav	are we moving toward a big brother surveillance state

download_data_path/process_wavs/159.wav	who also have severe disease which includes low blood oxygen levels

download_data_path/process_wavs/210.wav	it's on April 15th she drove to the hospital and had an ultrasound of her kidney

download_data_path/process_wavs/149.wav	Esperanza Community School in Phoenix Arizona has also handed out Chromebooks and Wi-Fi hotspots to some of its students

download_data_path/process_wavs/22.wav	recently there was an outbreak at a nightclub District in Seoul

download_data_path/process_wavs/125.wav	and those things have been in short supply

download_data_path/process_wavs/238.wav	now he's leading up a 15-member commission to help guide New York towards using new technology in the wake of covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/161.wav	you know what strikes me you know from a public health perspective there's no doubt that there was little information in the beginning about this virus and some of the information that we know has changed

download_data_path/process_wavs/9.wav	deer has students who are also dreamers undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children and he has students that are working essential jobs while they also balance online classes

download_data_path/process_wavs/209.wav	then they began to recognize the symptoms

download_data_path/process_wavs/51.wav	Health officials advise staying at least six feet away from others because the virus has a respiratory disease

download_data_path/process_wavs/97.wav	I've been hearing all sorts of questions like these so I wanted to speak with Jennifer Nazo

download_data_path/process_wavs/184.wav	we were still talking at that point about whether people should postpone their spring break travel plans

download_data_path/process_wavs/39.wav	and that might mean high tech Solutions

download_data_path/process_wavs/41.wav	there are these long demanding shifts the risk of exposure to the virus and the number of patients that are dying which is unlike anything we have ever dealt with before

download_data_path/process_wavs/0.wav	last week dr. Breen a New York City emergency room doctor died by Suicide

download_data_path/process_wavs/123.wav	keep in mind a lot of people never show symptoms but can still spread the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/237.wav	and that's just the creative problem-solving why song has been apart of outside the classroom

download_data_path/process_wavs/216.wav	still some celebrities share these claims to their millions of followers on social media

download_data_path/process_wavs/190.wav	after students have been set up with food and Wi-Fi is when her real job and the real connection begins

download_data_path/process_wavs/136.wav	it looks like pets especially cats and dogs Ken contract covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/259.wav	now they're also plenty of antibody test floating around that have not been reviewed or validated by the FDA

download_data_path/process_wavs/141.wav	when you're testing for the virus the biggest problem would be having a false negative

download_data_path/process_wavs/203.wav	I've been reporting on it since 2014 when it was tested as an experimental treatment for Ebola

download_data_path/process_wavs/109.wav	Thailand is considering special tourism Resorts that also double as quarantine zones

download_data_path/process_wavs/137.wav	regardless of what you might think about Wireless technology there is no connection between that sort of technology and a highly transmissible virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/18.wav	ultimately we need to really think carefully about the risks and benefits of using the sort of technology in our battle

download_data_path/process_wavs/99.wav	that's Chris Deere 2020 Louisiana teacher of the year and a finalist for the 2020 national teacher of the year

download_data_path/process_wavs/165.wav	the PCR test requires certain transport mediums reagents and yes nasal swabs

download_data_path/process_wavs/147.wav	to start off my ask for read what his biggest fear was for the future

download_data_path/process_wavs/218.wav	because of the coronavirus pandemic Diaz experience has become a common one

download_data_path/process_wavs/227.wav	it's a process that minimizes exposure to the virus and could also save people some travel and wait time

download_data_path/process_wavs/102.wav	aside from requiring face masks with You're simply going to see more of some airlines are also reducing food and beverage services in flight

download_data_path/process_wavs/255.wav	in the short-term Lee is preoccupied with just keeping meimei afloat

download_data_path/process_wavs/53.wav	for example Irene Lee doesn't see her Boston restaurant may may hosting sit-in diners anytime soon

download_data_path/process_wavs/20.wav	any New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city will produce its own covid-19 test kits in partnership with a 3D printing company

download_data_path/process_wavs/131.wav	she actually contracted covid-19 herself after recovering she went back to work

download_data_path/process_wavs/251.wav	truth is we already have some of it in place now

download_data_path/process_wavs/29.wav	but we have to remember that some people have a lot more at risk and they should also be protected

download_data_path/process_wavs/167.wav	Frontier Airlines is the first US carrier to announce plans to implement temperature checks

download_data_path/process_wavs/162.wav	in Denmark cafeterias are disappearing and students now eat in their classrooms to avoid large gatherings

download_data_path/process_wavs/260.wav	what is the right sort of path of leadership when you're dealing with little information or evolving information

download_data_path/process_wavs/126.wav	according to the CDC most Municipal Drinking Water Systems should remove or inactivate the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/157.wav	and then they dispatched volunteers to provide psychological support to anyone who wants it over the phone

download_data_path/process_wavs/12.wav	the hope is that will soon have something that works kind of like an at home pregnancy test

download_data_path/process_wavs/214.wav	again the test for the virus is the PCR or diagnostic test the test for the antibody is called a serology test

download_data_path/process_wavs/93.wav	and with high false negative people feel that they don't have the virus and they go back out in the community and potentially continue the spread

download_data_path/process_wavs/244.wav	and what's going to happen in the future is still unclear

download_data_path/process_wavs/243.wav	that was dr. Dan Erickson he and another doctor came under Fire for downplaying covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/45.wav	and the reason that were talking about it is because it still seems to be a source of confusion for some people

download_data_path/process_wavs/171.wav	New York is in the u.s. is pandemic epicenter with more than 321000 people infected and 25000 deaths

download_data_path/process_wavs/267.wav	and now the antigen test look for a protein on the surface of the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/63.wav	because she was nervous about covid-19 Dia initially wasn't sure if she should go in for her appointment

download_data_path/process_wavs/55.wav	as for swimming pools there's no evidence that the virus can be spread through the water in pools hot tubs or water play areas

download_data_path/process_wavs/150.wav	Rose says it is already started shipping its new test two leading labs around the world

download_data_path/process_wavs/115.wav	Hannah y son teaches science and English at Esperanza mostly to low-income students she has helped distribute food boxes and gift cards to grocery stores

download_data_path/process_wavs/191.wav	take it all off I couldn't think of anyone else better to talk to than my friend and colleague Fareed Zakaria

download_data_path/process_wavs/186.wav	to learn more about it I spoke to my colleague dr. Gregory esper a neurologist and also director of telemedicine at Emory University

download_data_path/process_wavs/58.wav	but in the long run they're still not so sure

download_data_path/process_wavs/148.wav	others have said they are limiting seat selection options to allow more distance between passenger

download_data_path/process_wavs/172.wav	even a very small amount can get you very sick and possibly even kill you

download_data_path/process_wavs/154.wav	in any given year 30 million people to 40 million people may become infected and that means 30,000 to 40000 people will die

download_data_path/process_wavs/100.wav	the antigen test in this case would just be used to screen

download_data_path/process_wavs/185.wav	Apple and Google are collaborating to develop software that would enable Bluetooth based tracking on their devices

download_data_path/process_wavs/166.wav	that CNN International correspondent David Culver he's been reporting from Shanghai in Wuhan throughout this pandemic

download_data_path/process_wavs/65.wav	well first of all last week the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for Rim Desert View

download_data_path/process_wavs/10.wav	retete strip will change color to tell if you might have the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/104.wav	the restaurant is delivering groceries to healthcare workers and selling Pantry Staples to the community like milk and eggs

download_data_path/process_wavs/178.wav	like dr. McDonald said doctors are facing so many challenges right now

download_data_path/process_wavs/242.wav	for now this is a medication that has to be administered in the hospital through an IV by a healthcare provider

download_data_path/process_wavs/176.wav	some of them are using more extensive surveillance than others

download_data_path/process_wavs/8.wav	I mean right now we hear about States reopening obviously all over the country

download_data_path/process_wavs/174.wav	these practices are part of what's known as telemedicine

download_data_path/process_wavs/1.wav	if users opt-in this data would be shared with governments and public health authorities

download_data_path/process_wavs/84.wav	and customers even receiving full body disinfectant sprays don't worry with their clothes on

download_data_path/process_wavs/69.wav	some lions and tigers at the Bronx Zoo also tested positive for the virus the Zeus has a staff member likely infected the cats

download_data_path/process_wavs/108.wav	I didn't know what that was he said it's sort of like Anthropologie he was inspired to teach partly because of a formative personal experience

download_data_path/process_wavs/94.wav	those problems are being addressed now but there are still supply chain shortages

download_data_path/process_wavs/263.wav	let me tell you what this FDA emergency use authorization really means

download_data_path/process_wavs/142.wav	I've always valued his perspective as a political scientist and generally very smart guy

download_data_path/process_wavs/11.wav	you really want to get that false positive rate under 2% as low as possible really

download_data_path/process_wavs/220.wav	and these teachers have come up with all kinds of new ways to do that as well

download_data_path/process_wavs/270.wav	the CDC recommends treating your pets as you would other Human family members that means you don't let them interact with others outside the home

download_data_path/process_wavs/250.wav	a company called Roche announced that it received emergency use authorization eua for an antibody test it claims is more accurate than most

download_data_path/process_wavs/17.wav	outside the United States different countries have also been trying different things

download_data_path/process_wavs/121.wav	last month they told NBC news that they're already in talks with several state and federal agencies to help with contact racing

download_data_path/process_wavs/140.wav	and there was also the release of a flawed test which really put us far behind

download_data_path/process_wavs/128.wav	New Zealand and Australia have committed to creating a travel bubble that allows visits between the two countries without quarantine once it's safe to do so

download_data_path/process_wavs/112.wav	Randazzo beers not a cure but it's a start and it could be a very important start

download_data_path/process_wavs/25.wav	and a low sensitivity means a high false negative

download_data_path/process_wavs/88.wav	that's Larry Lynch senior vice president of Science and Industry at the National Restaurant Association

download_data_path/process_wavs/133.wav	are we facing do you think a global depression

download_data_path/process_wavs/269.wav	Lee and her employees are already starting to answer those questions

download_data_path/process_wavs/226.wav	closing is restaurants in March was extremely difficult

download_data_path/process_wavs/66.wav	aside from the changes we can see happening now there will likely be more in the future

download_data_path/process_wavs/113.wav	in the absence of a so-called restaurant Playbook the National Restaurant Association which is a lobbying group is doing what it can to try and offer some guidelines for reopening

download_data_path/process_wavs/68.wav	so she called the hospital and spoke to a nurse about what they were doing to keep patients safe

download_data_path/process_wavs/271.wav	and because they're such a small amount of that genetic material it is then Amplified that's the polymerization chain reaction

download_data_path/process_wavs/193.wav	that person needs to be isolated and then everyone who has had close contact with that person needs to be traced

download_data_path/process_wavs/247.wav	but that's not all the school is providing I think a lot of us forget how integral schools are to our communities even if you're not a student there

download_data_path/process_wavs/158.wav	Chris Wyckoff who teaches American history to 11th graders in North Carolina has taken advantage of our Reliance on the internet to send his students some encouragement

download_data_path/process_wavs/188.wav	that's going to start in June

download_data_path/process_wavs/207.wav	this is an experimental drug and antiviral

download_data_path/process_wavs/153.wav	but as this pandemic drags on wysong and her colleagues are looking ahead to long-term challenges Families my face

download_data_path/process_wavs/201.wav	again like I said we don't yet have a reliable antigen test for covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/3.wav	government officials are now calling upon silicon Valley's Tech leaders to try and help

download_data_path/process_wavs/81.wav	China has begun allowing domestic travel although its borders are still shut the most foreigners

download_data_path/process_wavs/92.wav	he's the director of the Emory Travel well Center

download_data_path/process_wavs/181.wav	in one study of 12 antibody test for were shown to deliver false positive results more than 10% of the time

download_data_path/process_wavs/208.wav	it is true that there are similarities but dr. Anthony falchi for example has warned that coronavirus could be ten times more lethal than the flu

download_data_path/process_wavs/59.wav	in Taiwan for example there are now plastic partitions around the desks at elementary school students during lunch

download_data_path/process_wavs/57.wav	but just last week the mayor of Los Angeles announced free diagnostic testing

download_data_path/process_wavs/236.wav	during normal times for work is incredibly physical and requires personalized interactions with each student

download_data_path/process_wavs/91.wav	could what's happening in South Korea also happen in the United States

download_data_path/process_wavs/111.wav	the covid-19 pandemic is changing our lives in so many ways

download_data_path/process_wavs/219.wav	it involves a saliva test in some cases or more commonly a nasal swab

download_data_path/process_wavs/152.wav	my colleague has been covering the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the United States educational system

download_data_path/process_wavs/135.wav	but during this strange difficult national teacher appreciation week it's nice for them to hear that their efforts haven't gone unnoticed

download_data_path/process_wavs/224.wav	adult doctor Crystal and dr. McDonald bring up a more deeply rooted issue about the culture of Medicine

download_data_path/process_wavs/49.wav	here again is Paula hancocks CNN's International correspondent in South Korea

download_data_path/process_wavs/6.wav	it's been a big problem

download_data_path/process_wavs/60.wav	there is so much about this virus that is new and unfamiliar making everyday life more challenging

download_data_path/process_wavs/33.wav	will we be scan for fevers every time we step into an office or a restaurant

download_data_path/process_wavs/28.wav	Andrea the future of travel is touchless and paperless

download_data_path/process_wavs/82.wav	chain called restaurants cultural Banks and worries about the erosions this pandemic has had on all aspects of the dining experience

download_data_path/process_wavs/19.wav	proper maintenance along with the use of disinfection agents should inactivate the virus in the water

download_data_path/process_wavs/95.wav	now it's the United States turn to determine what must be done to open school safely

download_data_path/process_wavs/78.wav	Lysol manufacturer issued a statement clarifying that its products should never be administered into the human body

download_data_path/process_wavs/134.wav	what do you think needs to happen to convince people to travel again

download_data_path/process_wavs/44.wav	her work focuses on surveillance and cybersecurity

download_data_path/process_wavs/4.wav	the teachers we spoke to said they've mostly work out the Kinks of remote learning and they feel optimistic about finishing the year apart from their students

download_data_path/process_wavs/138.wav	so with the diagnostic virus test you really have to reduce false negatives

download_data_path/process_wavs/217.wav	then someone might feel that they have the antibodies that's feel that they are protected go out into the community to a hospital to a nursing home and spread the virus

download_data_path/process_wavs/248.wav	Tamiflu also doesn't care patients but it can reduce how long they are sick and how severe that sickness is

download_data_path/process_wavs/96.wav	reopening others may be even harder

download_data_path/process_wavs/143.wav	it's fascinating to look at them

download_data_path/process_wavs/38.wav	by the way the doctors video which has been shared on YouTube has since been taken down for violating the platform's policy on this information

download_data_path/process_wavs/257.wav	the FDA is allowing the use of this drug remedez of year for adults and children suspected or confirmed to have covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/64.wav	there are real consequences to losing our privacy so where do we draw the line

download_data_path/process_wavs/13.wav	he's also the host of the Netflix show Ugly delicious

download_data_path/process_wavs/183.wav	here's one thing to keep in mind flu can be very deadly about .1% of people who become infected with the flu will die from it

download_data_path/process_wavs/110.wav	some of us may feel like we have nothing to hide and so nothing to fear

download_data_path/process_wavs/79.wav	now we don't know what these standards are yet and we don't know how permanent they could be

download_data_path/process_wavs/169.wav	I like everyone else Abrams has come up with ways to make it work

download_data_path/process_wavs/2.wav	his show GPS is a forum for discussion on global Affairs featuring conversations with political and Business Leaders from around the world

download_data_path/process_wavs/24.wav	we are learning they can get from humans and in rare situations pass it on to other pets

download_data_path/process_wavs/200.wav	I asked dr. McDonald about how he's coping with his everyday reality as well as the loss of a colleague

download_data_path/process_wavs/73.wav	then there are the antibody tests those are the ones that can determine whether or not someone has had covid-19 in the past and might have some immunity to it now

download_data_path/process_wavs/75.wav	this is dangerous it won't work and it could get you really sick so let me repeat it once more don't drink any cleaning products

download_data_path/process_wavs/231.wav	I wanted to know what role technology might play in our fight against this pandemic

download_data_path/process_wavs/103.wav	in other words you probably won't get the coronavirus in the water but you could get it from someone close to you in the water

download_data_path/process_wavs/16.wav	the number of Medicare beneficiaries who receive telemedicine visits Rose from 10,000 a week to 300,000 a week in the last week of March according to the Wall Street Journal

download_data_path/process_wavs/21.wav	officials were concerned that this was motivated by these conspiracy theories

download_data_path/process_wavs/127.wav	he's been on the Frontline for weeks taking care of patient after patient after patient

download_data_path/process_wavs/34.wav	I recently spoke with dr. Steven McDonald he's an ER doctor at the same hospital is dr. Breen

download_data_path/process_wavs/62.wav	our boarding passes are already on our phones and we already check in online

download_data_path/process_wavs/30.wav	fortunately deal was scheduled for a routine ultrasound on April 15th

download_data_path/process_wavs/235.wav	she's an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health security

download_data_path/process_wavs/168.wav	Lynch said it's already begun

download_data_path/process_wavs/155.wav	the most common and most accurate test we have is called a PCR test a polymerase Chain Reaction test

download_data_path/process_wavs/76.wav	At first she didn't know what it was

download_data_path/process_wavs/206.wav	now the vaccine may not protect you entirely but it could shorten the duration if you get it

download_data_path/process_wavs/223.wav	I talked with him about how and when students from pre-k to college Michael back to classrooms

download_data_path/process_wavs/249.wav	this won't surprise you

download_data_path/process_wavs/213.wav	it's actually borrowed one method of calming her students down from a children's yoga certification course

download_data_path/process_wavs/195.wav	the benefit on average was about 31%

download_data_path/process_wavs/262.wav	this is one of them

download_data_path/process_wavs/27.wav	Dr Kristal and his team also established a buddy system pairing healthcare workers with their peers

download_data_path/process_wavs/258.wav	if an antigen test is approved and mass-produced it may serve as a valuable screening tool

download_data_path/process_wavs/145.wav	what is probably not going to replace the PCR saliva or swab test when it comes to diagnosing covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/15.wav	but we who was a finalist for this year's James Beard Rising Star Chef award has still managed to find a silver lining

download_data_path/process_wavs/98.wav	does that sort of translate ultimately into distrust

download_data_path/process_wavs/105.wav	you don't need to worry about getting covid-19 in your tap water

download_data_path/process_wavs/46.wav	and she's hoping the industry as a whole does the same especially in the areas where it was struggling

download_data_path/process_wavs/164.wav	I want you to listen to how dr. foutch she responded when asked about this in a Snapchat interview

download_data_path/process_wavs/268.wav	christening this is another Chris said there were hiccups using videoconferencing at first

download_data_path/process_wavs/83.wav	now there's another kind of test that could be useful here it's called an antigen test

download_data_path/process_wavs/254.wav	these days she struggles to get her students to sit still in front of the camera

download_data_path/process_wavs/163.wav	attacked the American College of Emergency Physicians called the claims Reckless untested and inconsistent with any current science or epidemiology regarding covid-19

download_data_path/process_wavs/273.wav	but recently a government-funded study found that hospitalized patients who took remedez of your intravenously recovered about 4 days faster than patients who didn't

download_data_path/process_wavs/129.wav	learning online might seem easy enough if you're a student with a computer where the internet but they are also has students who didn't have the luxury of these tools

download_data_path/process_wavs/72.wav	a reliable antigen test for the coronavirus isn't yet available in the United States

download_data_path/process_wavs/117.wav	Lori Abrams finds is challenging to

download_data_path/process_wavs/170.wav	will those under quarantine have to wear wristbands

download_data_path/process_wavs/146.wav	here's the problem antibody test have not been consistently accurate there are a lot of bad tests out there

download_data_path/process_wavs/54.wav	she has a history of kidney stones and realized that that would explain the pain

download_data_path/process_wavs/239.wav	restaurants are already testing out new methods

download_data_path/process_wavs/194.wav	deette was in and out of the hospital in less than an hour

download_data_path/process_wavs/47.wav	but he thinks he knows what it's going to take to find them

download_data_path/process_wavs/275.wav	another country the note South Korea which has been applauded for how well it handled the pandemic thanks to its thorough testing and contact tracing process

download_data_path/process_wavs/272.wav	I keep in mind emergency use authorization doesn't mean that this is an FDA-approved drug

download_data_path/process_wavs/196.wav	so how available are PCR and antibody tests to the general public is probably the question I get more than any other

download_data_path/process_wavs/256.wav	let me be clear about this under no circumstances should you ingest or inject any cleaning products

download_data_path/process_wavs/36.wav	but that doesn't mean pools may not be shut down in certain areas this summer

download_data_path/process_wavs/261.wav	so I decided to call him again to talk about all the changes in travel that have happened just over the last couple months and all the changes he thinks will still happen in the future

download_data_path/process_wavs/189.wav	Lee is taking this time to rethink how a restaurant should operate

download_data_path/process_wavs/124.wav	Wyckoff has been proud of how well his dude and set the Johnston County Career and Technical Leadership Academy have taken the online classes

download_data_path/process_wavs/14.wav	that could help stop infected people from spreading the virus before they even show symptoms

download_data_path/process_wavs/265.wav	if you're testing for antibodies and you get a false positive people may incorrectly assumed they now have the antibodies and are protected and then go out in the public and keep spreading

download_data_path/process_wavs/90.wav	we decided to ask Erica Richter from the American Society of travel advisors

download_data_path/process_wavs/31.wav	with the antibody test what you really hoping to avoid is a false positive

download_data_path/process_wavs/246.wav	I hear some big differences first of all the flu has been around for a while

download_data_path/process_wavs/42.wav	but again the initial rollout of those tests was fraught with problems and that caused major delays in the country's early response to the pandemic

download_data_path/process_wavs/50.wav	what do you think has been the most surprising change to travel since we last spoke

download_data_path/process_wavs/130.wav	the ACLU recently put out guidelines about how we can safely and effectively use technology in contact racing while also minimizing our privacy risks

download_data_path/process_wavs/252.wav	I've heard that from my colleagues everyday they wander are they safe

download_data_path/process_wavs/234.wav	for some experts that means we're going to have to rely on technology for touchless travel

download_data_path/process_wavs/67.wav	it didn't work back then

download_data_path/process_wavs/264.wav	why because you would think that you don't have the virus and then you might go back out into the community into a nursing home into a hospital and potentially infect people

download_data_path/process_wavs/199.wav	it's thoughtful its innovative is what's necessary

download_data_path/process_wavs/144.wav	the cat is out of the bag so to speak on this one

download_data_path/process_wavs/70.wav	you may have already had one of these if you ever had a test for strep throat or the flu

download_data_path/process_wavs/77.wav	every day this week I'm going to be talking to experts from all different fields about what we can expect in the months and years to come the future of travel education surveillance and more

download_data_path/process_wavs/85.wav	Plaza Monday Johns Hopkins University's covet tracking project was reporting over 7 million people in the United States have been tested

download_data_path/process_wavs/241.wav	hospitals have quickly taken their services online

download_data_path/process_wavs/119.wav	but as you might imagine this system has raised some concerns about privacy rights

download_data_path/process_wavs/222.wav	are there advantages that this type of learning offers over bricks and mortar

download_data_path/process_wavs/106.wav	if we're looking at that sort of timeline which people have suggested as possible given the vaccine production that is necessary and all that

download_data_path/process_wavs/26.wav	he had to furlough around 800 workers in this week decided to close two of his restaurants

download_data_path/process_wavs/89.wav	we do use contact racing in this country for other diseases lot of people are hearing this term for the first time

download_data_path/process_wavs/221.wav	and then there is Clearview AI a facial recognition technology company

download_data_path/process_wavs/7.wav	the agency said Monday that it was tightening its policy to keep on proving and even fraudulent s from entering the market

download_data_path/process_wavs/80.wav	but that's the long-term

download_data_path/process_wavs/197.wav	some of the photos show pulley systems delivering coffee temperature checks at the door

download_data_path/process_wavs/132.wav	if all goes well results usually come back within a few hours but I can take a few days if you have to send it to a lab somewhere

download_data_path/process_wavs/274.wav	and remember this testing does need to go hand-in-hand with contact racing

download_data_path/process_wavs/5.wav	since then there have been a lot of unauthorized unvalidated tests which it flooded the market

download_data_path/process_wavs/175.wav	at least two cats and a dog have tested positive in the United States

download_data_path/process_wavs/122.wav	when we first began this podcast I talked about travel safety all the way back in the 4th episode with dr. Henry Wu
