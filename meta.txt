process_wavs/43.wav	widespread antibody testing would also give us a better sense of exactly where the virus is

process_wavs/253.wav	a 2004 study of the transmission of SARS in Beijing found that consistently wearing a mask in public could reduce risk of Contracting Stars by 70%

process_wavs/61.wav	when you decided that you wanted to do something about this yourself what inspired you to do that

process_wavs/179.wav	I was devastated to learn that she passed away

process_wavs/202.wav	and those ones aren't necessarily just about your health they'll be about your mortgage

process_wavs/180.wav	dr. Jones told me fundamental to all of this is still the basic idea of identifying who is sick

process_wavs/118.wav	it could be true that a significant number of people have had covid-19 without realizing it

process_wavs/37.wav	Michigan lawmaker Tyrone Carter who contracted the virus himself explain why on CNN

process_wavs/32.wav	and if you're listening today and looking for help yourself we also have a list of resources to get you the help you need

process_wavs/212.wav	the outline some of the other issues that make Black America more vulnerable starting with the fact that they are disproportionately low-income

process_wavs/116.wav	until something is done to address the mounting Health crisis in America's jails and prisons the medical professionals working there remain on the front lines

process_wavs/151.wav	the lack of an adequate stockpile and Global Supply Chain disruptions have contributed to this issue

process_wavs/204.wav	but again it is the structural inequalities that have led to these higher rates of pre-existing illness

process_wavs/87.wav	already more than a hundred people who are homeless in New York City have tested positive for the Coronavirus

process_wavs/177.wav	the US Food and Drug Administration has not authorized any test for covid-19 that you can buy yourself or do it home

process_wavs/232.wav	it put us one step closer to understanding if and how humans can reach farther planets like Mars

process_wavs/198.wav	I asked Reverend bayley about loss and if she had any advice on how to come to terms with it especially at this time

process_wavs/71.wav	right before my interview with Reverend Bailey I reported on the death of Charlotte Figi

process_wavs/211.wav	that is completely false

process_wavs/120.wav	city and county officials created a makeshift homeless shelter in a parking lot

process_wavs/245.wav	so the benefits of antibody testing are clear

process_wavs/182.wav	you know what's interesting I've traveled to so many places around the world and it always strikes me that many Americans are not really used to dealing with scarce resources

process_wavs/215.wav	will number one be suspicious of any product that claims to have a quick fix

process_wavs/139.wav	there's also been a lot of misinformation

process_wavs/205.wav	homemade masks like scarves or Bandana's won't filter out all potentially harmful droplets but they'll reduce the potentially harmful droplets that you're expelling

process_wavs/40.wav	plus he has some underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes

process_wavs/229.wav	local governments in cities like Los Angeles Laredo Texas and New York City had already recommended that citizens wear some form of face covering

process_wavs/35.wav	and when I found change my mind

process_wavs/114.wav	like Becky many others across the country are stepping up and doing things like buying groceries for other more vulnerable folks who probably shouldn't be doing it themselves

process_wavs/233.wav	it is sad but true that so many black Americans have higher rates of some underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes

process_wavs/23.wav	I became close to Charlotte and I became close to her family

process_wavs/225.wav	it's the first criminal fraud case the US justice department is Prosecuting in the coronavirus pandemic

process_wavs/156.wav	director of The Centers for Disease Control and prevention dr. Robert Redfield address this on NBC's The Today Show

process_wavs/187.wav	could you go back and look at the history look at the origins and many ways it started with a little girl

process_wavs/56.wav	we've seen a spike in hunger across the country as millions of people have lost their jobs and income due to cities being virtually shut down

process_wavs/107.wav	I first met her back in 2013

process_wavs/86.wav	medical professionals say that prisons and jails can be especially dangerous incubators for infectious diseases

process_wavs/230.wav	it's not just exposure people who are homeless also tend to have more health problems putting them at greater risk if they do become infected with the virus

process_wavs/240.wav	this is dangerous because not only might you lose your money you could also get a fake test kit that could give you a false result

process_wavs/52.wav	Tony Huston who we heard from at the beginning was able to register to get tested for antibodies in Santa Clara County

process_wavs/173.wav	but the CDC now recommends that everyone cover their face as a precaution

process_wavs/160.wav	talk about social distancing Scott Kelly was over 200 miles from the planet Earth

process_wavs/74.wav	that's Elijah McDowell who's incarcerated at Willard cybulski Correctional Institute

process_wavs/228.wav	Eric warned that food bank supplies could soon run short

process_wavs/101.wav	I've also got a lot of emails about a long post that's been going around the internet

process_wavs/192.wav	the Connecticut Department of Corrections says that as of Monday 18 inmates in this facility have tested positive for covid-19

process_wavs/266.wav	we asked Ben and Jessica Jackson and attorney and the chief advocacy officer for reform Alliance to explain their safer plan

process_wavs/48.wav	compared to the covid-19 diagnosis test which is an invasive nose swab typically this test is pretty simple

process_wavs/159.wav	allegedly selling a fake sure to is 2.4 million Instagram followers

process_wavs/210.wav	the city's Department of Corrections says that as of April 12th New York City has about 4,000 inmates in custody

process_wavs/149.wav	this is how he describes the conditions there

process_wavs/22.wav	but Elijah still worried that the virus is spreading

process_wavs/125.wav	while many of the people who are homeless in New York live in shelters in Los Angeles the situation is the opposite

process_wavs/238.wav	epidemiologist dr. Camara Phyllis Jones who was also a former president of the American Public Health Association Echo those same sentiments

process_wavs/161.wav	it helps take our mind off our current living situation

process_wavs/9.wav	just two days after Feinberg letter was sent to the White House the president announced the cdc's new guidelines

process_wavs/209.wav	is that a good analogy as you know a significant percentage of people became infected on that ship

process_wavs/51.wav	that's the US Surgeon General dr. Jerome Adams talking to CBS

process_wavs/97.wav	I love that there I think everyone who hears that loves it

process_wavs/184.wav	they can be identified with a quick blood test also called a serology test

process_wavs/39.wav	this might especially be helpful for healthcare workers and essential workers who could do their important jobs without worrying

process_wavs/41.wav	to be fair the general consensus is that it is not exactly clear how much this will help

process_wavs/0.wav	because there is so much that we still don't know about this virus some of the lack of information can be filled easily with bad information

process_wavs/123.wav	play Mark out boxes on the ground so people could sleep 6 feet apart

process_wavs/237.wav	a source with knowledge of the situation says that one homeless shelter exposed to the virus could overwhelm two or three hospitals

process_wavs/216.wav	I spoke to bear who like many other kids is currently out of school

process_wavs/190.wav	many people wondered at the time if healthcare workers needed them why didn't the rest of us

process_wavs/136.wav	despite that risk some places are starting to test people anyway

process_wavs/259.wav	in his announcement about new Mass guidelines Trump emphasized that the average person who isn't displaying symptoms of covid-19 does not need a surgical or respirator mask

process_wavs/141.wav	reform Alliance is pushing politicians to adopt a new plan called safer which aims to protect people living and working inside America's jails and prisons

process_wavs/203.wav	van says he's particularly worried about the south where the majority of America's black community lives

process_wavs/109.wav	it says it's from the Stanford Hospital board

process_wavs/137.wav	again the purpose of a mask is not to protect yourself so much as to protect others from you

process_wavs/18.wav	Elijah is in prison for a parole violation and a weapons violation

process_wavs/99.wav	in Atlanta a nonprofit Called Love Beyond walls has been installing portable sinks for those on the streets to wash their hands

process_wavs/165.wav	when you were delivering these supplies the bars in the electrolyte fluids to the hospital I'm sure that had to have been a really gratifying thing you must have felt really good about it

process_wavs/147.wav	New York city has the largest homeless population in the country

process_wavs/218.wav	some black people have come out and said that wearing a mask could put them at even greater Danger

process_wavs/227.wav	mask-wearing in countries like Taiwan South Korea and China may have contributed to lower infection rates and Rapid containment of outbreaks in those countries

process_wavs/102.wav	he said part of the reason he wanted to get tested for antibodies was to help researchers find out whether the coronavirus could have arrived in the United States sooner than they realized

process_wavs/255.wav	and the National Institutes of Health are recruiting up to 10,000 volunteers for antibody testing as well

process_wavs/53.wav	he was arrested when he delivered pills to an undercover FBI agent and charged with one count of attempted wire fraud

process_wavs/20.wav	the World Health Organization says that it does not and will never asked for any login information

process_wavs/131.wav	so what can be done to level the playing field

process_wavs/251.wav	Houston said he never got tested for covid-19 but he was really sick back in January was several of the common symptoms of the disease

process_wavs/29.wav	black Americans like Elijah who is also Hispanic are incarcerated at several times the rate of white Americans

process_wavs/167.wav	we don't know for sure whether having had the virus gives you immunity against it but Health experts do suspect that's the case

process_wavs/162.wav	number 3 do your homework

process_wavs/260.wav	as you've always heard if it's too good to be true it probably is

process_wavs/126.wav	I saw a picture of the situation and it is very unsettling

process_wavs/157.wav	he's from North Vancouver

process_wavs/12.wav	Carrie is I'm CNN

process_wavs/214.wav	and that nothing was working for her she had been having 300 seizures a week

process_wavs/93.wav	if you do press one on this call an operator impersonates the federal government and tries to take your credit card information

process_wavs/244.wav	they are donating their blood for an experimental treatment known as convalescent plasma

process_wavs/243.wav	but it goes even further to include a social bias

process_wavs/45.wav	number two and I can't say this enough don't share your personal information to anyone on the phone or online

process_wavs/171.wav	she like many other officials is urging the government to keep comprehensive demographic data on people who are tested

process_wavs/267.wav	we are seeing people from all walks of life come together to support their local businesses their healthcare workers and their communities

process_wavs/63.wav	could cause adverse effects and even interfere with any medications you currently take

process_wavs/55.wav	welcome back to him later

process_wavs/150.wav	the CBD movement in so many ways is something that everyone knows about now

process_wavs/115.wav	that blood samples then put on a test strip that contains protein from the virus

process_wavs/191.wav	it's just a finger prick to draw a small blood sample

process_wavs/186.wav	we asked the Connecticut Department of Corrections about Elisha's claims and they said they were not aware of the incident

process_wavs/58.wav	give me the headlines by raising more than $2,000

process_wavs/148.wav	but now cover your face when you leave your house if you're going to be in a public setting where it's difficult to maintain social distance

process_wavs/172.wav	in Illinois 15% identify as black or African-American but they make up 43% of deaths

process_wavs/154.wav	it was an amazing story and it inspired me to search the world and find out if there were other patients like her and what scientists were saying and other places

process_wavs/100.wav	the IRS says that you don't need to sign up or call to get your payment

process_wavs/185.wav	and then our family tried CBD and ingredient in the cannabis plant it is a non-intoxicating part of the plant and considered to have some medicinal properties

process_wavs/166.wav	some hospitals in Italy were so overwhelmed with patients they reported having to choose which patients to prioritize

process_wavs/65.wav	but prisoner Advocate groups like reform Alliance are pushing for more to help the over 2 million people incarcerated in America today

process_wavs/10.wav	not to fall for anyone who ask for personal or financial information in order to get their $1,200 stimulus check

process_wavs/104.wav	right now testing is being done through labs and are ordered by medical professionals

process_wavs/178.wav	those should be reserved for healthcare workers on the front lines

process_wavs/242.wav	so many of these products could be dangerous to you and your family

process_wavs/176.wav	I asked dr. Rosner what doctors at Rikers were doing to fight the spread of covid-19

process_wavs/8.wav	dealing with long-term isolation is one of the challenges that comes with space travel

process_wavs/174.wav	they won't charge you money to apply for a job or go to a conference

process_wavs/1.wav	as I've said before we should all behave as if we have the virus

process_wavs/84.wav	some like Angela live in a shelter While others are forced to live on the streets or subways

process_wavs/69.wav	it won't tell you whether the virus is currently active in your body just whether it has ever been active in your body

process_wavs/108.wav	dr. Harvey fineberg one of the scientists who sent the letter to the White House last week said he would start wearing a mask when he goes to the grocery store

process_wavs/94.wav	and yet it was still illegal and her mom Paige had to make the CBD oil in her own kitchen

process_wavs/263.wav	conditions that may also increase the risk for covid-19

process_wavs/142.wav	and as the fight for personal protective equipment or PPE throughout the country continues

process_wavs/11.wav	not just within Healthcare settings but within food delivery grocery stores and pharmacies

process_wavs/220.wav	at the briefing where the new guidance was announced Surgeon General Jerome Adams acknowledged the back and forth over mask-wearing

process_wavs/270.wav	now Scott wasn't completely alone Russian cosmonaut Mikhail kornienko was always with him

process_wavs/250.wav	it is to keep you from spreading the disease not necessarily to protect you from getting the disease

process_wavs/17.wav	so what is the test

process_wavs/121.wav	in Seattle the county purchased a former Motel to isolate victims who didn't need hospitalization including the homeless

process_wavs/140.wav	3M is the world's largest manufacturer of respirator masks

process_wavs/128.wav	last week White House coronavirus Task Force member dr. Anthony falchi told CNN that a test is coming soon

process_wavs/112.wav	a movement wrapped up in this sweet little girl with a big smile and an even bigger heart

process_wavs/25.wav	people doing work risking their lives in order to keep the country running

process_wavs/88.wav	and 319 of them have covid-19 to have died

process_wavs/133.wav	I want to talk a little bit about what's been going on in the world what is your life been like with covid-19

process_wavs/269.wav	people who had coronavirus are also giving back

process_wavs/226.wav	and why does antibody testing matter

process_wavs/66.wav	as well as other crewmates who rotated in and out of the space station

process_wavs/113.wav	dr. Rosner works at Rikers Island a correctional facility located on an island in New York City's East River

process_wavs/68.wav	those who test positive for antibodies can likely resume their normal lives

process_wavs/271.wav	we asked her to walk us through what life is like there

process_wavs/193.wav	you get really close to people that you cover sometimes

process_wavs/247.wav	the Coalition for the homeless runs a mobile soup kitchen every night but because many other services have shut down there's even more of a demand

process_wavs/158.wav	what is it that you miss the most

process_wavs/188.wav	but so have individual Hoarders

process_wavs/207.wav	yet they make up 41% of coronavirus deaths

process_wavs/153.wav	and one of its faults claims is that people can find out whether they have covid-19 by simply holding their breath for more than 10 seconds

process_wavs/201.wav	in fact if you file your taxes electronically you'll get it through direct deposit

process_wavs/3.wav	lack of access to good food lack of access to healthcare

process_wavs/81.wav	across the country some authorities are already taking action to release inmates

process_wavs/92.wav	he and his crewmates also listened to a lot of music

process_wavs/181.wav	she works at Duke University in North Carolina but over a month ago she started shopping for the elderly on her lunch breaks

process_wavs/208.wav	but how soon could any of us actually reap those benefits

process_wavs/59.wav	now there are also a lot of other scams out there

process_wavs/57.wav	has the government Dan Community organization scramble to navigate the outbreak

process_wavs/236.wav	5 have died

process_wavs/91.wav	that's Giselle Ruthie are policy director at Coalition for the homeless a non-profit based in New York City

process_wavs/111.wav	his twin brother was the perfect control for the study

process_wavs/219.wav	knowing who has antibodies against covid-19 could also speed up the search for a cure

process_wavs/152.wav	Stanford Health Care told CNN that the post is not affiliated with Stanford medicine and that it contains inaccurate information

process_wavs/135.wav	in fact when you answer the phone and hear a recorded message instead of a live person that's a robocall and it's most likely a scam or even illegal

process_wavs/224.wav	in February Adam said tweeted a plea for people to stop buying masks so there would be enough for healthcare workers

process_wavs/49.wav	there's no doubt this virus has brought into even greater Focus the structural inequalities in our Healthcare System

process_wavs/6.wav	each section on the website takes you to a list of vetted Charities where you can donate or get involved

process_wavs/60.wav	right now many of us are facing a similar challenge here on Earth

process_wavs/33.wav	he did it in just two days to help by healthy snacks for healthcare workers at his local hospital

process_wavs/28.wav	the company said in response that it is working to comply with President Trump's order to ramp up mass production

process_wavs/82.wav	feinberg's letter pointed to the growing body of evidence about the role of asymptomatic people

process_wavs/19.wav	antibodies are proteins in the immune system that are created soon after an infection

process_wavs/95.wav	some prisoners are suing local governments for release while some organizations like reform Alliance are donating medical supplies to prisons

process_wavs/78.wav	remember that right now there is no cure for covid-19

process_wavs/134.wav	but it certainly won't hurt

process_wavs/44.wav	additionally they say they are protecting staff and inmates by canceling social visits and releasing as many prisoners as they can

process_wavs/4.wav	we spoke to him about his experience

process_wavs/138.wav	there are vaccines and treatments that are in clinical trials but none have yet been proven effective by the FDA

process_wavs/217.wav	Advocates say finding shelter for people on the streets is a top priority

process_wavs/248.wav	the numbers are changing everyday but as of April 6th New York City officials have released over 1,500 people

process_wavs/96.wav	Angela has been living at our shelter for more than 2 years now

process_wavs/143.wav	these days Humanity as a whole has suffered great losses whether it's the loss of a job a routine someone we love

process_wavs/38.wav	and since many hotels are now vacant advocates in New York City and Los Angeles are calling on government officials to use them

process_wavs/257.wav	that's nine year old Jonathan Young who goes by the nickname bear

process_wavs/64.wav	so here at CNN our impact your world team has compiled an interactive guide to connect you with organizations helping those affected by the crisis

process_wavs/13.wav	he was hospitalized but is now recovered

process_wavs/183.wav	a little girl who changed the world and my own life

process_wavs/110.wav	in some ways we've known this for a long time it is the essence of asymptomatic spread spreading without symptoms

process_wavs/79.wav	in the meantime we are seeing organizations and individuals who are stepping in with Creative Solutions to help

process_wavs/169.wav	this is key because so many people who have had covid-19 have not displayed any symptoms

process_wavs/2.wav	for example as the CDC released new guidelines urging people to wear masks

process_wavs/24.wav	Santa Clara county in California Miami-Dade County in Florida and Telluride Colorado are a few places now conducting antibody tests

process_wavs/200.wav	in Michigan where I grew up 14% of the population is black

process_wavs/73.wav	Angela says she has a friend in another shelter who got the virus from his roommates

process_wavs/75.wav	I spent a lot of time with her while I was filming the documentary series about medical marijuana called weed

process_wavs/231.wav	just last week the Department of Health and Human Services redistributed almost 200,000 medical grade n95 masks and other medical supplies

process_wavs/103.wav	results like that are what make the conflicting guidance on masks so confusing

process_wavs/16.wav	I spoke to dr. Zachary Rosner chief of Medicine with the New York City Correctional Health Services

process_wavs/21.wav	in which 20% of the federal prison population becomes infected

process_wavs/127.wav	there are also so many scams for covid-19 treatments or cures they include teas essential oils or drugs

process_wavs/34.wav	I asked dr. Rosner at Rikers if he's taking any special precautions when he goes home at the end of the day

process_wavs/62.wav	last week Bureau of Prisons director Michael carbajal told CNN he is preparing now for a worst-case scenario

process_wavs/30.wav	just last week in Las Vegas a shelter housing 500 homeless people was forced to close after one man tested positive for Coronavirus

process_wavs/235.wav	that CNN commentator and Criminal Justice Reform Advocate van Jones

process_wavs/168.wav	FDA commissioner Steven Han was asked about this on NBC's Meet the Press

process_wavs/155.wav	I asked White House coronavirus Task Force member dr. Anthony falchi about the Optics of mask last week before the Trump administration had issued any new guidance

process_wavs/76.wav	but there are still a lot of challenges that can use your help

process_wavs/206.wav	I know many of you want to help I hear it from you all the time

process_wavs/223.wav	even at his young age bear is one of the countless people going to extraordinary lengths to help

process_wavs/249.wav	you may be wondering how they make those tough decisions

process_wavs/213.wav	many places like gyms in public libraries where people on the streets used to access bathrooms and showers have now closed

process_wavs/195.wav	the Federal Trade Commission has a very simple recommendation hang up

process_wavs/262.wav	homeless Advocates say though this is just a short-term solution and what they really need is sustainable housing options

process_wavs/27.wav	racial and ethnic data will enable us to better inform communities at greater risk and allow us to tackle the underlined inequality that is still plaguing the system

process_wavs/258.wav	President Trump announced separately last week that he had invoked the defense production act to bolster the supply chain and get more masks and ventilators to those in need

process_wavs/145.wav	Scott also says that having a hobby is important

process_wavs/15.wav	on top of Housing and sanitation access to proper food is also a challenge

process_wavs/98.wav	there's no need to hoard anything not masks not toilet paper

process_wavs/105.wav	I've lost people who mean a lot to me in the last few weeks

process_wavs/46.wav	their largest single-day distribution in there 40 year history

process_wavs/164.wav	all of this is humankind at its best inspiring and uplifting

process_wavs/268.wav	well there are several reasons it's important to know who has antibodies against covid-19 in might be immune to it besides Peace of Mind Of course

process_wavs/83.wav	covid 19 may be spread through talking or even breathing not just coughing or sneezing

process_wavs/254.wav	and how underlying health issues play into it

process_wavs/163.wav	in Pittsburgh dr. Jim Withers and his team have been going out into the streets to check in on people

process_wavs/273.wav	go back to work visit friends without fear of infecting others we're getting sick again

process_wavs/129.wav	trust official sources like the CDC the World Health Organization or your local state or city Health Department

process_wavs/72.wav	That's Tony Houston who got tested for covid-19 antibodies in San Jose California earlier this month

process_wavs/117.wav	some scammers have been impersonating the authorities were looking to for information

process_wavs/170.wav	pictures of seemingly endless lines of cars went viral last Thursday as the organization gave out more than a million pounds of food

process_wavs/146.wav	that's Criminal Justice Reform Advocate and CNN commentator van Jones

process_wavs/54.wav	and now we're seeing that black Americans are also disproportionately affected by covid-19

process_wavs/239.wav	homeless shelters are often at the bottom of the list after emergency rooms and First Responders

process_wavs/194.wav	on Tuesday he sounded the alarm about the racial disparity in deaths as a result of covid-19

process_wavs/47.wav	she gave it to Charlotte and it worked

process_wavs/272.wav	about how the novel coronavirus would affect the homeless population in the United States

process_wavs/196.wav	a similar pattern is emerging in Louisiana

process_wavs/256.wav	van Jones is the organization CEO

process_wavs/36.wav	additionally 573 of about 11,000 staff members have also tested positive for the virus

process_wavs/261.wav	when he was in space Scott took up photography he shot breathtaking photos of Earth from a port hole in the Floor of a lab module

process_wavs/189.wav	they might give you false results

process_wavs/124.wav	Randall Kuhn and associate professor of Public Health at the University of California Los Angeles recently co-authored a report

process_wavs/14.wav	so be aware of bad antibody test being offered online

process_wavs/265.wav	Vans concerns are well-founded

process_wavs/90.wav	the Federal Communications Commission says that government agencies will never call you asking for money or personal information

process_wavs/31.wav	since April 8th the state has been transferring all infected inmates to an isolation unit in a separate facility

process_wavs/246.wav	so how can you protect yourself from these scams

process_wavs/42.wav	Not only would it be a medical failing to withhold a plant that could help so many people I started to wonder aloud if it was a moral failing as well

process_wavs/50.wav	and if they can do that without coughing it says they don't have the virus

process_wavs/130.wav	as part of the recent to trillion-dollar stimulus package the government is allocating for billion dollars to State and local governments for homeless assistance

process_wavs/252.wav	it's still not clear just how big a role asymptomatic transmission plays in the spread of the disease

process_wavs/234.wav	she founded an organization called the faith matters Network and is ordained in the African Methodist Episcopal Church

process_wavs/67.wav	dr. Adams also gave instructions for how best to use a face covering

process_wavs/264.wav	and on top of that Black America is disproportionately at the front line of this pandemic

process_wavs/199.wav	she was 6 years old and I was told that she had intractable epilepsy

process_wavs/144.wav	can you tell me about some of the reaction that you got from people

process_wavs/70.wav	but what we are saying from some states is pretty shocking

process_wavs/77.wav	which puts certain communities at greater risk

process_wavs/85.wav	as of this recording only one covid-19 antibody test has emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration

process_wavs/241.wav	and the only call for donations they have is for the covid-19 solidarity response fund

process_wavs/119.wav	van and Jessica say that local state and federal officials need to start implementing the safer plan in prisons and jails before it's too late

process_wavs/222.wav	so I decided to ask Scott for some advice since he's pretty uniquely qualified to talk about isolating for an extended. Of time

process_wavs/106.wav	they wanted to see how human body adapted to extreme conditions in space

process_wavs/26.wav	so what are antibodies

process_wavs/89.wav	at last week's CNN Town Hall my colleague Anderson Cooper and I spoke to a recovered coronavirus patient whose plasma is now being used to treat current patients

process_wavs/221.wav	so if your blood reacts to the strip it means you have antibodies
